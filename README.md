# For challenge reviewers ðŸ‘‹
## Some disclaimers
in challenge says: "generate", in order of this, will be use a POST method in this senario, for the meneang of POST verb.

choose use `phone_numner` header, to get key to identify the current user in order to emulate some user token.

This code probably taste like an overkill solution, but it was funny to wrote.
I hope you enjoy reading and testing
